Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) is a fundamental part of Computer Science that teaches you how to think and solve complex problems systematically.


Using the right data structure and algorithm makes your program run faster, especially when working with lots of data.

Knowing DSA can help you perform better in job interviews and land great jobs in tech companies.
